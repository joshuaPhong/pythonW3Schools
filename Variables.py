# python has no variable command
# variables are created when a value is assigned
x = 5
y = "john"
# see main for output
# variables are not declared by type and the type can change
x = "john"  # x is now a string type
# type can be pecified by casting
x = int(3)
y = str(3)
z = float(3)
# strings can be in '' or "" quotes
# variable names are case-sensitive
#     A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#     A variable name cannot start with a number
#     A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#     Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
#     A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
#   Assigning multiple values to multiple variables on a single line
val_one, val_two, val_three = 1, 2, 3
#   Assign the same vale to multiple vaariables
val_four = val_five = val_six = 456
# unpack a collection such as list and tuple
listForUnpacking = ["list one", "list two", "list three"]
list_one, list_two, list_three = listForUnpacking
